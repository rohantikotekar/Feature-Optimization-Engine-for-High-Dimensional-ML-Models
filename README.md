# Feature Optimization Engine for High Dimensional ML Models

## Problem Statement

A Machine Learning model is as good as its data. During pre-processing, ML Engineers face the problem of feature selection. Dropping irrelevant features is a key step for the model to perform well. However, this process cannot yield optimal results if it is done purely based on Human judgement. 

## Solution

My method automates the process of finding the best possible features to get a good accuracy. It uses forward propagation and backward elimination algorithms to find the most optimized subset of features. These features are then given to the ML model for training. 

## Output (Backward Propagation)
