# Feature Optimization Engine for High Dimensional ML Models

## Problem Statement

A Machine Learning model is as good as its data. During pre-processing, ML Engineers face the problem of feature selection. Dropping irrelevant features is a key step for the model to perform well. However, this process cannot yield optimal results if it is done purely based on Human judgement. 

## Solution

My method rates feature importance based on taking various permutations of the overall features.
